**Single Responsibility Principe (SRP):**
A class should have a single responsibility or purpose. One way to evaluate whether a class complies with this principle is by analyzing the reasons it has to change.

A class should be open to extensions and closed to modifications. This means that once a class is considered complete, it should not be modified unless there is a functionality issue that needs to be fixed.

**Liskov Substitution Principle:**
A subclass must be able to replace its base class without altering the behavior expected by the client.

**Interface Segregation Principle:**

**Dependency Inversion Principle:**
