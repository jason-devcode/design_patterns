## Design Patterns Classifications  
Design patterns are common solutions to recurring problems related to designing the interaction between the elements or components of software at the code level. These problems include maintaining code flexibility and reusability, the flexibility and efficiency of structures, ensuring effective communication, and properly assigning responsibilities among objects. Based on the types of problems a pattern can solve, they can be classified into three general groups:  

**Creational Patterns:**  
Creational patterns address problems related to object creation, providing mechanisms for object creation that enhance flexibility and code reusability.  

**Structural Patterns:**  
Structural patterns focus on solving problems regarding how objects and classes are assembled into larger structures while maintaining as much flexibility and efficiency as possible in the structures.  

**Behavioral Patterns:**  
Behavioral patterns solve problems related to how objects communicate with each other, ensuring effective communication and proper responsibility assignment among objects.
