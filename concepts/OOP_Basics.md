# Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

## OOP Basic Concepts

**Object-Oriented Programming**:
Object-Oriented Programming (or OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 
representing real-world objects in a computer 
using data structures. These data structures, called objects, 
encapsulate both behaviors (methods) and attributes (states), 
making them resemble real-world objects. This encapsulation allows 
objects to model real-world entities effectively, providing a natural 
and intuitive way to design software systems.


**Classes:**
When we need to represent a group of real-world objects in a computer system, 
where these objects share common behaviors and attributes, we extract their 
shared characteristics and create an abstract 
representation of them. This abstraction serves as a general blueprint 
that represents the entire group of objects in a consistent way. Using 
this blueprint, we can create individual objects of the same type, 
each with its own unique attributes (or states). This blueprint is what 
we call a class, as it represents a "class" of objects from the real world.


**Encapsulation:**
Encapsulation is the ability of an object to hide internal details so that they are only available to itself and expose only what is necessary for other objects to interact with it.


**Interfaces:**
When one object needs to interact with another, it does so through an interface that the other object exposes publicly for others to interact with it.
