# Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

## OOP Basic Concepts

**Object-Oriented Programming**:
Object-Oriented Programming (or OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 
representing real-world objects in a computer 
using data structures. These data structures, called objects, 
encapsulate both behaviors (methods) and attributes (states), 
making them resemble real-world objects. This encapsulation allows 
objects to model real-world entities effectively, providing a natural 
and intuitive way to design software systems.


**Classes:**
When we need to represent a group of real-world objects in a computer system, 
where these objects share common behaviors and attributes, we extract their 
shared characteristics and create an abstract 
representation of them. This abstraction serves as a general blueprint 
that represents the entire group of objects in a consistent way. Using 
this blueprint, we can create individual objects of the same type, 
each with its own unique attributes (or states). This blueprint is what 
we call a class, as it represents a "class" of objects from the real world.
