## Software Design Principies

**Encapsulate what varies:**
This principle focuses on identifying and isolating the parts of a system that are most likely to change, encapsulating them so that any modifications to those parts do not affect the behavior or functionality of the rest of the system. By doing so, it simplifies code maintenance, enhances extensibility, and minimizes the risk of errors by reducing dependencies between stable and variable components.
